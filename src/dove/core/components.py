``dove.core.components``
========================

Module containing component classes that form the basis of DOVE models.

Components are connected through resources they consume and produce, forming
a directed graph that represents a system model. Each component can have
associated cash flows to motivate the optimization and transfer functions that define
how resources flow through the component.

Classes
----------
    - `Component`: Abstract base class for all components in a DOVE model
    - `Source`: Component that produces a resource
    - `Sink`: Component that consumes a resource
    - `Converter`: Component that transforms input resources into output resources
    - `Storage`: Component that can store a resource for later use

Types
----------
    - `TimeDependent`: Type alias for time series data (list of floats or NumPy array)

    A base component class for energy system modeling.

    This abstract class defines the common interface and validation for components
    in an energy system. Components have time-dependent capacity constraints, can consume and produce
    resources, and can have associated cashflows.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Unique identifier for the component.
    installed_capacity : float
        Nameplate capacity of the component.
    capacity_factor : TimeDependent
        Fraction of the installed_capacity that is available to dispatch, by timestep.
    consumes : list[Resource]
        Resources consumed by this component.
    produces : list[Resource]
        Resources produced by this component.
    min_capacity_factor : TimeDependent
        Minimum allowable activity as a fraction of installed_capacity; defaults to 0.0 for every timestep.
    capacity_resource : Resource | None
        The resource that defines capacity, if any.
    flexibility : Literal["flex", "fixed"]
        Whether the component's operation is flexible or fixed in optimization.
    cashflows : list[CashFlow]
        Economic cashflows associated with this component.
    transfer_fn : TransferFunc | None
        Function defining resource conversion logic.

    Notes
    -----
    This is an abstract base class that should be subclassed to implement
    specific component types like generators, grids, storage, etc.

        Validate and process the component's attributes after initialization.

class Converter(Component):
    """
    A Component subclass that converts resources from one type to another.

    The Converter class represents components that consume one set of resources and
    produce another, different set of resources.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ramp_limit : float
        Maximum rate of change for the component's capacity
        utilization between timesteps as a fraction of installed capacity.
        Must be a value between 0 and 1. Default is 1.0 (no limit).
    ramp_freq : int
        Frequency at which ramp limitations are applied.
        Default is 0 (every timestep).
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the parent Component class.

    Notes
    -----
    - A Converter requires an explicitly specified 'capacity_resource', which is
      the resource to which the capacity limits refer.

class Storage(Component):
    """
    Storage component for modeling energy storage systems.

    This class represents a storage component in the energy system, capable
    of charging and discharging a specific resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    resource : Resource
        The resource type that this storage can store.
    rte : float
        Round-trip efficiency, between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.0.
    max_charge_rate : float
        Maximum charge rate as a fraction of installed capacity
        per time period, between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.0.
    max_discharge_rate : float
        Maximum discharge rate as a fraction of installed capacity
        per time period, between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.0.
    initial_stored : float
        Initial stored amount as a fraction of installed capacity,
        between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.0.
    periodic_level : bool
        If True, storage level at the end of the simulation
        must equal the initial level. Defaults to True.
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the parent Component class.
        It's important to note that some Component attributes may not be
        applicable to Storage components, such as `produces`, `consumes`,
        and `capacity_resource`. These attributes are set automatically
        based on the `resource` parameter as necessary.

    Notes
    -----
    Storage components are treated differently from other components in terms of
    capacity and resource management. They can store energy for later use,
    and their operation is governed by the round-trip efficiency (rte) and
    charge/discharge rates.
