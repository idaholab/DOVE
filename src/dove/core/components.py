========================

Module containing component classes that form the basis of DOVE models.

Components are connected through resources they consume and produce, forming
a directed graph that represents a system model. Each component can have
associated cash flows to motivate the optimization and transfer functions that define
how resources flow through the component.

Classes
----------
    - `Component`: Abstract base class for all components in a DOVE model
    - `Source`: Component that produces a resource
    - `Sink`: Component that consumes a resource
    - `Converter`: Component that transforms input resources into output resources
    - `Storage`: Component that can store a resource for later use

Types
----------
    - `TimeDependent`: Type alias for time series data (list of floats or NumPy array)

    A base component class for energy system modeling.

    This abstract class defines the common interface and validation for components
    in an energy system. Components have capacity constraints, can consume and produce
    resources, may have time-dependent profiles, and can have associated cashflows.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Unique identifier for the component.
    max_capacity : float
        Maximum operational capacity of the component.
    consumes : list[Resource]
        Resources consumed by this component.
    produces : list[Resource]
        Resources produced by this component.
    min_capacity : float
        Minimum operational capacity, defaults to 0.0.
    capacity_resource : Resource | None
        The resource that defines capacity, if any.
    profile : TimeDependent
        Time-dependent profile for operation, as a numpy array.
    capacity_factor : bool
        Whether the profile represents a capacity factor (0-1)
        rather than absolute values.
    flexibility : Literal["flex", "fixed"]
        Whether the component's operation is flexible or fixed in optimization.
    cashflows : list[CashFlow]
        Economic cashflows associated with this component.
    transfer_fn : TransferFunc | None
        Function defining resource conversion logic.

    Notes
    -----
    This is an abstract base class that should be subclassed to implement
    specific component types like generators, grids, storage, etc.

    rte : float
        Round-trip efficiency, between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.0.

        Maximum charge rate as a fraction of capacity per time period,
