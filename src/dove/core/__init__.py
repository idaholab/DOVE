========================

Core module for DOVE optimization framework.

This module provides the foundational classes and functions for building
and managing energy system models in DOVE. It includes classes for
components, resources, cash flows, and transfer functions. These classes
are essential for defining the structure and behavior of energy systems
and for performing optimization and simulation tasks.
