========================

Price Taker Builder Module

This module provides a builder class for creating price taker optimization models
within the DOVE framework. A price taker represents a market participant that
accepts energy market prices as given and optimizes operations accordingly.

The PriceTakerBuilder constructs a Pyomo optimization model with:
- Sets for components (storage and non-storage), resources, and time periods
- Variables for resource flows, state of charge, and charge/discharge rates
- Constraints for resource balances, capacity limits, and storage operations
- An economic objective function optimizing market participation

The model incorporates both standard generation/consumption components and
storage components with their associated charge/discharge dynamics and state
of charge tracking.

Notes
-----
The price taker model focuses on economic optimization of resource flows
without attempting to influence market prices.

    Builder class for creating price taker optimization models.

    This class implements the builder pattern to construct a price taker optimization
    model step by step. A price taker model represents a participant in an energy
    market that accepts prices as given and optimizes their operations accordingly.

    The builder adds sets, variables, constraints, and an objective function to
    the optimization model, and provides methods to solve it and extract results.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : pyo.ConcreteModel
        The Pyomo concrete model being constructed.
    system : object
        The energy system being modeled, containing components, resources, and time indices.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> builder = PriceTakerBuilder(system)
    >>> model = builder.build().solve()
    >>> results = builder.extract_results()
