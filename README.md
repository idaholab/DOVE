# Dispatch Optimization Variable Engine (DOVE)
[![tests](https://github.com/idaholab/DOVE/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/idaholab/DOVE/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

# Installation

Regardless of the installation method you select, you must ensure that you have the necessary solver(s) installed on your system in order to use DOVE. DOVE uses Pyomo for optimization and supports any solver supported by your Pyomo version.

### Install Using Pip (Recommended) (TODO: Waiting on PyPI release)
If you do not need access to the source code for DOVE, the simplest method of installation is to run the following:
```
pip install dove-inl
```

### Install from Source
DOVE may be downloaded from source according to the procedure outlined below. If you would like to contribute to DOVE, please refer to the [Developer Reference](https://idaholab.github.io/DOVE/references/developer.html) documentation page as you follow these instructions. If you are not interested in contributing but would still like access to the source code, these instructions are sufficient.

First, ensure that the necessary prerequisites are installed on your system:
- **Python 3.11+** ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git** ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **uv** ([Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

Now navigate into the desired folder and clone the repository from github:
```
mkdir projects
cd projects
git clone https://github.com/idaholab/DOVE.git
```
Next, dependencies can be installed using uv while in the DOVE directory:
```
cd DOVE
uv sync
```
> Note that this command also automatically creates an environment located at `DOVE/.venv`, in which the dependencies are installed. Prepending `uv run` to commands while in the DOVE directory will automatically load this environment.

Finally, to verify your installation, run tests:
```
uv run pytest
```

# Quick-Start
Once DOVE has been installed, it can be used as a library in a python script. DOVE contains three main types of objects: Resources, Components, and Systems.
- **Resources** refer to quantities that can be produced, consumed, converterted, and stored. Examples are electricity, heat, hydrogen, etc.
- **Components** are objects that perform actions on resources. Four types of Components are available in DOVE. Sources produce a specified resource; Sinks consume a specified resource; Converters change one or more resource into one or more other resources; and Storage components store resources across multiple timesteps.
- **Systems** contain sets of Resources and Components and are responsible for solving the optimization problem. Systems also take an argument to specify the time window over which the optimization should run. Usually only one system is created for each dispatch problem.

Consider a simple energy system with a nuclear power plant and generator, wind turbines, and battery storage, connected to a grid. The resource flow for this system is shown below:

Dispatch for this system can be economically optimized using DOVE in a python script:

```
import dove.core as dc

steam = dc.Resource(name="steam")
elec = dc.Resource(name="electricity")

nuclear = dc.Source(name="nuclear", produces=steam, max_capacity_profile=[3, 3])
gen = dc.Converter(
    name="generator",
    consumes=[steam],
    produces=[elec],
    capacity_resource=elec,
    max_capacity_profile=[3, 3],
    transfer_fn=dc.RatioTransfer(input_res=steam, output_res=elec, ratio=1.0),
)
wind = dc.Source(name="wind", produces=elec, max_capacity_profile=[1, 2])
battery = dc.Storage(name="battery", resource=elec, max_capacity_profile=[1, 1], rte=0.9)
grid = dc.Sink(
    name="grid",
    consumes=elec,
    max_capacity_profile=[3, 6],
    cashflows=[dc.Revenue(name="elec_sales", alpha=1.0)],
)

sys = dc.System(
    components=[nuclear, gen, wind, battery, grid], resources=[steam, elec], time_index=[0, 1]
)
results = sys.solve("price_taker")
print(results)
with open("simple_demo.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write(results.to_csv())
```
This script can be run in the uv environment and will print the dispatch results as well as writing them to a csv file called "simple_demo.csv":
```
>>> uv run python examples/simple_demonstration.py
   nuclear_steam_produces  generator_electricity_produces  ...  grid_electricity_consumes  objective
0                     3.0                             3.0  ...                       -3.0        8.9
1                     3.0                             3.0  ...                       -5.9        8.9
```

Here are the formatted results from this script:

|    |   nuclear_steam_produces |   generator_electricity_produces |   generator_steam_consumes |   wind_electricity_produces |   battery_SOC |   battery_charge |   battery_discharge |   grid_electricity_consumes |   objective |
|-------------:|-------------------------:|---------------------------------:|---------------------------:|----------------------------:|--------------:|-----------------:|--------------------:|----------------------------:|------------:|
|            0 |                        3 |                                3 |                         -3 |                           1 |      0.948683 |                1 |                 0   |                        -3   |         8.9 |
|            1 |                        3 |                                3 |                         -3 |                           2 |      0        |                0 |                 0.9 |                        -5.9 |         8.9 |

# Developers
Before installing DOVE, developers must install the following prerequisites in addition to those listed in the [Install from Source](#install-from-source) section:
- **pre-commit** (Framework for managing Git hooks)
- **An IDE or text editor** with Python support (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

Some tools frequently used by developers include:
- **Git** (for a variety of applications related to source control)
